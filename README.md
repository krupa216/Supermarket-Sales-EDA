## Supermarket Sales EDA

Project Overview: 
This project is about Exploratory Data Analysis on a supermarket sales dataset & data visualization.

## Tools Used
- Power BI (Dashboard & DAX) was used to build an interactive dashboard.  
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) was used for data analysis and visualization. 
- CSV Dataset

## Key Features  
The project shows total sales and quantity using KPI cards.  
Sales are analyzed by branch, city, and product line.  
Customer type, gender, and payment method distributions are visualized.  
Sales trends are shown over time using line and area charts.  
The relationship between quantity and total sales is analyzed using a scatter plot.  

## Power BI Visualization Advantages  
Power BI helps create interactive dashboards easily.  
It allows filtering and drill-down to explore data in real time.  
DAX formulas are used to calculate total sales and other measures.  
Dashboards are clean, professional, and easy to understand for business users.  

## Python Visualization Advantages  
Python is useful for data cleaning and preprocessing.  
It allows flexible and customized visualizations using Matplotlib.  
Python helps understand data patterns before building dashboards.  

## Comparison Summary  
Power BI is more suitable for dashboard creation and storytelling.  
Python is better for detailed data analysis and coding-based visualization.  
Using both tools together provides better insights.
